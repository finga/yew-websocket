# Yew-WebSocket
Rust yew websocket service written with love :)

This crate is based on the original yew websocket service that used to be part of the core library.
https://github.com/yewstack/yew/blob/0.18.0/packages/yew/src/services/websocket.rs

For some reason, the core team decided to kill it.

It tried using the suggested libraries, but they are not properly integrated with yew.
